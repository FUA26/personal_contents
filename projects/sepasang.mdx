### Summary

This project is an internal project at PT. Vascomm Solusi Teknologi, and it involves revamping the landing page. As a full-stack developer, I am part of a team of two developers, along with a design team and a QA team. The scope of the project includes not only the landing page but also the website's CMS, which is used to manage content.

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to revamp the landing page of PT. Vascomm Solusi Teknologi and add some additional pages, including "IT Solution" and "Startup Factory." The UI revamp will completely change the previous version of the landing page and make some major adjustments to support the UI changes.

### Problems

Since this project involves a UI revamp, most of the issues encountered are related to implementing the UI into the code. It is inevitable to face differences between the design and development teams, and there are some UI components that may not be feasible to implement.
